It uses the city name you input to make the request and retrieve relevant data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Based on the conditions (Clouds, Clear, Rain, etc.), different icons are displayed to give you a visual representation of the weather. 🌥️🌦️

The app shows the temperature in Celsius by default, but you can modify the app to support other units if desired. ⚙️
